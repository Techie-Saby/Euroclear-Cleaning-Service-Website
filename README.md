## Euroclear Cleaning Services Frontend

This repository contains the frontend codebase for Euroclear's cleaning services platform. Our goal is to provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive web application that simplifies the process of booking cleaning services and managing appointments for our clients.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structural foundation of our web pages, ensuring semantic markup, accessibility, and SEO-friendly content.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout, implementing responsive design principles and custom animations to enhance user experience.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that allows us to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making our stylesheets more maintainable and efficient.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers the interactive elements of our site, handling dynamic content, form validation, and asynchronous data fetching for a smooth user experience.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Utilized for its responsive grid system, pre-built components, and utility classes, ensuring a consistent and mobile-friendly user interface across devices.
- **PHP**: While primarily a backend language, we use PHP for server-side rendering and to create dynamic page content, integrating seamlessly with our frontend.

### Key Features

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices
- Interactive service booking system with real-time availability
- Customer dashboard for managing appointments and service history
- Dynamic pricing calculator based on service type and property size
- Integration with payment gateways for secure transactions
- Review and rating system for completed services

### Getting Started

To set up the project locally:
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have PHP installed on your local machine
3. Set up a local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP)
4. Place the project files in your server's web directory
5. Access the project through your local server's URL

### Development

For SCSS compilation and JavaScript bundling, we use a build process. To set this up:
1. Ensure Node.js is installed
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm run watch` for development to compile SCSS and bundle JS in real-time
4. For production, use `npm run build` to create minified assets
